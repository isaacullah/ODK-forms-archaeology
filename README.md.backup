# ODK-forms-archaeology
Forms for the Open Data Kit mobile data collection app

These are a series of [ODK](https://getodk.org/) forms I've created for my own archaeological field work. I provide them here, with no guarantees, warranties, support, or instructions, in case they may be useful for you. Most are provided in both the editable Excel spreadsheet form for use with [xlsform](https://xlsform.org/en/), as well as the final XML for import into ODK or GeoODX. One or two may only have the XML available, but can serve as examples. I may add more documentation in time. These materials are released [CCbyA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode). Please reference this repository and me in publications that result from your use or modification of any of these forms, and please let me know how you've used them. 

A reference for the ""BMAP Architecture Final" form is:

As I publish additional papers using some of the other forms, I will post them here.
